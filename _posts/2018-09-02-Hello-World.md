Hello everyone, I am [**Harsh Trivedi**](https://www.facebook.com/harsh98trivedi){:target="_blank"}, a **{{ 'now' | date: "%Y" | minus: 1999 }}**-year-old guy, who loves each and every aspect of *Technology*. My life started in a lovely city, **Kanpur** *(formerly Cawnpore)*,  the 11th most populous urban city located in the central part of **Uttar Pradesh, India**. I love Graphic Designing, Web Development, Video Editing, Travelling, Learning new things and Making new friends with similar interest and mindset.

*Computer*, is my most favorite subject since childhood, and has completely changed the way I think and understand things, the best part about a computer is the learning experience, whether you are designing some stuff, editing a video or programming an app, if you are doing all that with a goal in mind and with full dedication, you'll surely learn how things work and how you need to work with them or tweak them in your own possible way.

I am starting this [**Jekyll**](https://jekyllrb.com){:target="_blank"} based blog to share my thoughts, experiences, knowledge, and much more, I will share most of my social activities now and then, also I will be sharing some apps, websites, and tools that I have made or I am using for making my tech activities easy.

I currently live in Kanpur, where people are mostly boring, but exceptions are always there so I found [**KanpurFOSS Community**](https://kanpurfoss.org){:target="_blank"}, where we do [meetups](https://www.meetup.com/WordPress-Kanpur){:target="_blank"}, workshops, and a [WordCamp](https://kanpur.wordcamp.org){:target="_blank"} every year, I would like to thank KanpurFOSS Community for sharing an awesome tech experience here, in Kanpur.
<br>

If you want to know more [about]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/#about-section){:target="_blank"} me, you can simply [contact]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/#contact-section){:target="_blank"} me using different social media platforms mentioned in the navbar.<br>

I will also be sharing some of the Tweets, Facebook Posts, Instagram photos and YouTube videos using a simple embed or using some sort of API.
